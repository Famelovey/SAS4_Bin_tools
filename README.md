# SAS4_Bin_tools
Tools that i wrote (with the help of BowDown097#8946, NkIsAwesome#5882 and trainy#1000) for reading SAS 4 .bin files.

In order to make these tools work, you need Python 3.x.

After you've downloaded the .rar file, follow these steps:

1. Make new folder where you will unzip the tools (You can just unzip them inside GameData folder, too. If you do, skip step 2)
2. Put .bin files inside the new folder
3. Launch BIN_Decoder.py
4. Select .bin file you want to decode
5. Edit any .csv you want via CSV editing tools or just Notepad++
6. Launch BIN_Encoder.py
7. Select .csv file you want to encode

After these steps, you will get the modified .bin file in the Output folder which should work.
