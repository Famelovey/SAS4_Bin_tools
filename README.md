# SAS4_Bin_tools
Tools that i wrote (with the help of BowDown097#8946 and albert#1000) for reading SAS 4 .bin files.

To make this tools work, you need Python 3.x.

After you installed the .rar file, follow these steps:

1. Make new folder where you will unzip the tools
2. Make Output folder inside it
3. Put weapons.bin, ammo.bin, enemies.bin and equipment.bin inside folder where are tools located
4. Launch BIN_Decoder.py
5. Select .bin file you want to decode
6. Edit any .csv you want via CSV editing tools (Modern CSV, etc.)
7. Launch BIN_Encoder.py
8. Select .csv file you want to encode

After these steps, you will get the modified .bin file in the Output folder which should work.
