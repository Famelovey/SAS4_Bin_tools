# SAS4_Bin_tools
Tools that i wrote for reading SAS 4 .bin files.

Usage:

1. Make new folder where you need to unzip the tools
2. Make Output folder inside it
3. Put weapons.bin, ammo.bin and equipment.bin inside folder where tools located
4. Launch BIN_Decoder.py
5. Select .bin file you want to decode
6. Edit whichever csv you want via csv editing tools
7. Launch BIN_Encoder.py
8. Select .csv file you want to encode

After these steps, you will get the modified .bin file in Output folder, which should work.
